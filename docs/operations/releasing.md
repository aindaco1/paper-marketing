# Release workflow

A release is a separate task. Require a clean, committed source tree, a published exact Platform pin, passing CI/source/Swift gates, real-app acceptance, and reviewed notes. Never replace an already published version's archive or key.

1. Bump both versions in `Configuration/Info.plist`, update `CHANGELOG.md`, and write `docs/releases/VERSION.md`.
2. Run the contributor checks. Sign and package with `./script/package.sh --notarize`; the existing Apple Auth adapter reads credentials in place. Verify the app and DMG signatures, notarization/staples, Gatekeeper, bundle metadata, and a fresh source-ZIP build.
3. Generate `outputs/appcast.xml` with `python3 script/generate_appcast.py`. Paper's Sparkle Ed25519 private key stays in Keychain account `xyz.dustwave.paper`; only its public key is tracked. Secure key backup is operator-owned. Do not export a private key into the repository, logs, CI artifacts or public assets.
4. Run `python3 script/verify_release.py` to validate the mounted DMG, update app, exact committed source ZIP, checksums and signed feed. For an already published release, pass its tag with `--ref vVERSION`; `--directory` accepts a fresh public download directory. Build the source ZIP in a fresh temporary directory with `swift test` and `./script/build_and_run.sh --build-only`. After merging, require successful main-branch CI for that exact commit before tagging.
5. Publish a new GitHub tag/release in `aindaco1/paper` with its DMG, complete source ZIP, update ZIP, checksums and appcast. The official feed is the latest release's `appcast.xml`. Verify downloaded public assets against local hashes and signatures.
6. Exercise a safe older-version installation through Sparkle check, download, Install and Relaunch. Verify the final version and executable; preserve the user's app/preferences. A first updater release uses a local signed older-version fixture because 0.3.0 and earlier contain no updater. Never publish that fixture.

CI only builds/validates; it has no signing keys or release write permission. The updater installs only after user action. Local build, notarization, public feed and installed update acceptance are distinct outcomes.

## Reporting relay

Synchronize the app-owned `integrations/crash-relay` files using `node script/sync-crash-relay.mjs /path/to/crash-relay`. Keep the existing shared `ReviewedReportGroup`, product routes, bindings and permissions. Run all relay tests and dry-run deployment; deploy through its existing workflow. Add only Paper to the GitHub App's selected repositories if needed. Validate synthetic create/duplicate/aggregate/reopen delivery and close the synthetic issues. Existing namespaces must never be deleted for rollback; disable `PAPER_REPORTS_ENABLED` instead.

## Retention after a verified release

Keep the current signed app, DMG, source/update ZIPs, appcast, checksums and compact validation/notarization evidence in `outputs/`. Keep one development checkout, pinned sources, scripts and tests. Historical test evidence may be archived as small JSON/Markdown files; do not retain duplicate apps, extracted source trees or compilation caches merely to preserve a test result.

Remove superseded local build bundles and temporary test copies only after the public assets and older-version upgrade pass. `.build/`, `dist/`, helper binaries and source-ZIP scratch builds are reproducible. Check running executable paths and attached images before deleting. Preserve user preferences, imported recipes, Keychain keys, Apple Auth and unrelated projects.

Delete a branch only after proving it is merged, has no open PR and is not used by an active worktree. Leave published release tags/assets as release history; older public versions support rollback and updater testing. Do not delete another task's working checkout merely because its branch merged.
