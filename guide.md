# Get comfortable with Paper

Paper adds a texture over your Mac's displays. It is free and open source, and it will stay that way. It works on Apple Silicon Macs with macOS 13 or later.

## Install

Download the current DMG from [Paper releases](https://github.com/aindaco1/paper/releases/latest), open it, and drag Paper to Applications. Open Paper to see Settings. Closing Settings leaves Paper running in the menu bar; choose Quit to stop the app.

Use **Check for Updates…** for signed updates. Automatic checks can be disabled in Settings, and installation always requires your action. Versions through 0.3.0 need one manual installation of an updater-enabled version. Quit a pre-1.0 copy before installing manually.

## Pick a paper

Choose a texture and adjust intensity and grain. Soft Wove is the default. All 26 textures come from Deckle's pinned catalog. Favorite the ones you like; they move to the front of the picker and appear in the menu bar.

Save up to eight named looks to keep texture, intensity and grain together. Selecting a texture recalls its last intensity; display overrides stay independent. Applying a look never turns Paper on or overrides a pause rule.

## Make it fit your day

Fixed-time schedules use the Mac's local time and support overnight windows. Equal start and end times mean all day. Solar schedules use a city you choose and its time zone; the city does not change when you travel.

Automatic day/night looks can follow sunrise/sunset or the system's light/dark appearance. App-specific looks can assign a saved look to an app. A manual texture or saved-look selection ends automatic switching; re-enable it in Settings when wanted.

Battery rules can pause Paper on battery, in Low Power Mode, or at a chosen low-battery threshold. Returning to power only resumes the effect if the other visibility rules permit it.

## Pause or get out of the way

The menu bar offers toggle, snooze, favorites, the reading strip, presentation pause and Quit. Snooze offers preset durations, a custom duration, and tomorrow at 6 AM. Snooze survives relaunch.

Use **Pause for presentation** before sharing, recording or opening a protected authorization prompt. It stays paused until **End presentation pause**, even across relaunches. Check your recorder or sharing preview: capture tools can handle overlays differently.

Exclude apps or displays when you want them clear. **Only show in selected apps** restricts the effect to your chosen apps; an empty list shows nothing. Exclusions and manual off always win. The texture hides in Mission Control and stays visible during Dock reveal and Command-Tab.

## A few extra controls

Each display can use its own intensity. Desk profiles save a setup for the exact connected display identities; edits are stored only when you save that setup again.

The reading strip leaves a clear horizontal band through the texture and lighting. It does not follow your pointer. Desk Lamp adds an optional static warm wash. Both follow the normal pause rules.

The default toggle shortcut is **Shift–Option–Command–P**. Customize it in Settings; additional commands start unassigned. Native Shortcuts actions can toggle Paper, set its enabled state, snooze, select a texture, or apply a saved look.

## Bring your own paper

Choose **Import paper…** for Deckle JSON recipes. Export/import your library to back up custom papers, favorites and looks. Backups do not include every setting. See [recipes and backups](/docs/development/recipes/) for limits and examples.

## Privacy and help

Paper does not capture your screen or change display gamma. It needs no Accessibility, Input Monitoring or Screen Recording permission. Your settings and recipes remain local. City lookup, update checks and explicitly reviewed diagnostic submissions use external services; [privacy](/privacy/) explains them.

If something goes wrong, start with [Get help](/help/). For sensitive security reports, use the private channel in [Security](https://github.com/aindaco1/paper/blob/6ff7e17c1a53e93f94f6987fae508a8f9e8e2b95/SECURITY.md).
